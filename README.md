# eurorack modules

Welcome to my Eurorack module stash. This is a collection of modules I (partially) designed for use with eurorack synthesizers.

## modules

* midi2cv: a midi to cv converter - who could've guessed. 4 Channel 16 bit precision with full 10V pitch range, stm32f373 based
* stereo_mix: a 4 channel stereo (input AND output) mixer with voltage-controlled panning and volume. Digitally controlled via Multiplying DACs (MCP4922 in combination with MCP4822)
