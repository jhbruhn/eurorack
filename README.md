# eurorack modules

Welcome to my Eurorack module stash. This is a collection of modules I (partially) designed for use with eurorack synthesizers.

## modules

* **bus**: A tiny bus. not much to say.
* **out**: Befaco Outs on a separate pcb with SMD parts to manufacture it via JLC
* **pure_adsr**: Alternative firmware for the old GMSN Pure ADSR modules, using ADSR and mini sequencer modes from Peaks and a weird looping ADSR thing on mode 3
* **stereo_mix**: a 4 channel stereo (input AND output) mixer with voltage-controlled panning and volume. Digitally controlled via Multiplying DACs (MCP4922 in combination with MCP4822)
* **vca**: A dual channel variable slope (exp/lin/log) VCA based on easily available components
* **vcf-20**: MS20 style filter
* **vcf-leiter**: Moog style filter
